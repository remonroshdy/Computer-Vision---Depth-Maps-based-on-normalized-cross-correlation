For the visualization of stereo reconstruction to display a 3D wireframe object, you can leverage Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Plotly, or Mayavi. These libraries offer functionalities to create interactive 3D plots and visualizations. Matplotlib provides a straightforward interface for generating static 3D plots, while Plotly and Mayavi offer more interactive capabilities for visualizing 3D data. Depending on the level of interactivity and complexity required for the visualization, students can choose the most suitable library for their needs.

Regarding the visualization of dense distance meshes as 3D mesh plots, the "PyMesh" and "trimesh" modules are commonly utilized in Python for handling and visualizing 3D meshes. PyMesh provides a comprehensive set of tools for processing and visualizing meshes, including mesh creation, manipulation, and rendering functionalities. On the other hand, trimesh offers an easy-to-use interface for importing, manipulating, and visualizing triangular meshes in Python.
